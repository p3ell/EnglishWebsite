        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>Oscar Wilde was born in Dublin on the 16th of October, 1854. Wilde was well educated, going to Trinity College in Dublin and Magdalen College in Oxford. During his later years of education, Wilde became infatuated with the Aesthetic Movement, which valued the appearance of art and literature over its functions. After graduating, he moved to London to grow on his involvement in the movement and pursue a literary career.</p>
        <p>Wilde’s literary works were very diverse, consisting of poetry, novels (such as the Picture Of Dorian Gray), and even fairy stories. However Wilde was most known for his plays, being regarded as one of the best playwrights of the 19th century. His most popular plays include “The Importance of Being Earnest”, “An Ideal Husband”, and “Salome”.</p>
        <p>Wilde’s career would have gone on to be much more successful than it was, however tragedy struck in the 1890s for Wilde. In 1884, Wilde had married Constance Lloyd, and they had two sons, but in 1891 Wilde began an affair with a man named Lord Alfred Douglas, also nicknamed as “Bosie”. Back in this time period, being homosexual was strictly forbidden, and was heavily punishable.</p>
        <p> After the affair, it was only foreseeable that it would eventually get leaked to the public soon enough. This was the case in April of 1895, when Wilde sued Bosie’s father, the Marquis of Queensberry, for defamation, after the Marquis accused him of being homosexual. Wilde lost the trial, and after the evidence being released to the public in the trial, Wilde was trialed for gross indecency, and was sentenced to two years of hard labour. After his release, his reputation was irretrievably damaged, and he spent his last years in Europe, before dying of meningitis in Paris on the 30th of November, 1900.</p>
