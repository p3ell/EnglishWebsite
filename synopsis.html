        <h2>Synopsis</h2>
        <p>Dorian Gray, a young man famed for his beauty and youth, befriends an artist by the name of Basil hallward, who paints a fine portrait of Dorian. As Dorian Gray looks and admires the portrait, he wishes that he may preserve his youth and beauty while the painting may age. Dorian is influenced by his friend Lord Henry Wotton to pursue a life of little care and much self-centred pleasure and indulgence. </p>
        <p>He engages in many unethical and immoral activities, though his appearance remains untainted. Soon he discovers the painting has grown more grotesque and ugly with each of his wrongdoings. Dorian begins feeling immense guilt and self-doubt, so he takes a knife to the painting in a moment of despair. As he stabs the painting, it grows youthful again while Dorian ages rapidly and he succumbs to death.</p>
